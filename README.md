A janky little Chrome extension to format Wordle and Quordle results in a Discord-friendly, Dordle-like manner.

## Usage
This extension adds a context menu item that, when clicked, formats the results of a Wordle or Quordle game and copies it to the clipboard.

1. On either the Wordle or Quordle website, right-click to open the context menu
2. From the context menu, select:
    - *Copy formatted Wordle results* (on Wordle)
        - Can be used on either a complete or incomplete game
        - *The settings page may briefly appear on the screen in order to check for hard mode*
    - *Copy formatted Quordle results* (on Quordle)
        - Only works on a complete game (either practice or daily)
3. Paste into Discord for sharing

### Example
